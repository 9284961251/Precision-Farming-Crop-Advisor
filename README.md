# Precision-Farming-Crop-Advisor
Implemented a machine learning system using Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers to recommend optimal crops based on climate data, enhancing yield and resource use.
Our research aims to achieve the following objectives:

1.Crop Yield Prediction: To develop accurate machine learning models that predict crop yields based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
2.Crop Classification: To classify crops (label) based on their environmental requirements and growth characteristics, aiding in crop management.
3.Nutrient Optimization: To recommend optimal nutrient levels (N - nitrogen, P - phosphorus, K - potassium) for different crops, maximizing their growth potential.
4.Crop Rotation Guidance: To provide insights into crop rotation strategies that improve soil health and reduce disease risks.
By achieving these objectives, our study seeks to enhance agricultural productivity, sustainability, and resilience in the face of changing environmental conditions.
